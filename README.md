## About This Project

ASMAS Bank is a comprehensive and responsive fintech dashboard built from the ground up to showcase a modern, full-stack development workflow. This is not just a concept; it's a fully functional application designed to demonstrate advanced skills in front-end architecture, UI/UX design, API integration, and back-end simulation.

The project features a complete user journey, from a beautifully designed landing page to a secure, data-rich client dashboard, all powered by a custom-built Express.js mock server.

    ```
    This command will:
    -   Start the mock API server on `http://localhost:3001`
    -   Start the React development server on `http://localhost:5173`

### Development Decisions

-   **Custom Express Server:** Instead of a simple `db.json`, a custom Express server was built to more accurately simulate a real-world REST API, including custom logic for different endpoints and providing a more robust demonstration of back-end integration skills.
-   **Chakra UI:** Chosen for its excellent out-of-the-box accessibility, component-based styling, and powerful theming capabilities, which allowed for rapid development of a consistent and professional UI.
